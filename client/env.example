# Environment Variables for Taha World Client

# Backend API Configuration
# For production deployment, set one of these:

# Option 1: Full API URL (recommended)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://taha-world-backend.vercel.app/api

# Option 2: Backend base URL (will append /api automatically)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://taha-world-backend.vercel.app

# Development (automatically uses localhost:5050)
# No need to set these in development

# Vercel Deployment Instructions:
# 1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
# 3. Add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL with value: https://taha-world-backend.vercel.app/api
# 4. Redeploy your application

# IMPORTANT: After making config changes, you MUST:
# 1. Commit and push the changes to your repository
# 2. Trigger a new deployment in Vercel (or it will auto-deploy from git)
# 3. Clear browser cache or use incognito mode to test

# Note: The config.ts file now uses hostname detection as a fallback,
# so production domains (non-localhost) will automatically use the Vercel backend URL
# even if environment variables are not set.

# Debug: Check browser console for "🔧 Config Debug Info" to see current configuration
